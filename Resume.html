<h1>Vex Robotics Curriculum of the 360 Program</h1>

<p>High school robotics motivated me for computer programming. Working on our robot gave me a thrill to lead a group into getting 2nd place in the competition, as I was nominated to be the captain, autonomous programmer, and controller programmer. I then continued to be a volunteer for the advancing next robotics team, to guide them into creating a competitive designed robot.
